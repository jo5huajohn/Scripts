# Scripts
A collection of random simple scripts I use.

### Display_Trackpad_Orientation_Script.sh
This script rotates the display and the trackpad depending on the argument passed to it.

### Keyboard_Script.sh
This script disables the internal keyboard whenever an external bluetooth keyboard is connected.

### Lenovo_Legion_5_2020.sh
This script acts as a substitute to Lenovo Vantage and lets me toggle different functions.
